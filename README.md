# ModernSL

The ModernSL command provides a new - modern way to approach the "sl" command from linux. With more documentation. Command help and also many more eastereggs.

### The structure
ModernSL is made in C++ and contains largely most of the old sl's code to keep the nostalgic enviroment it had and the large impact on the linx userbase.

#### The current plan

ModernSL is planned to have continous support until it reaches EOL.
##### current situation
- [ ] Full support of all SL commands
- [ ] Pushed onto official apt PPA repository
- [ ] Version is complete
- [X] CMake and build instructions are complete
- [ ] Mannual and other resources are complete
- [X] Version Under Developement

ModernSL is under developement for beta tests. As of currently.

### How is it a useful tool?
ModernSL is a sleek command to teach users about how to not use ls and adds more fun to the linux enviroment. Eastereggs have proven to work in popularizing Linux as a more fun and interactive OS.

ModernSL tries to maintain compatibility to the old versions to keep the nostalgic fans of this command.
